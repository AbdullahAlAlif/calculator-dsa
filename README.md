# 🧮 Calculator – DSA Final Project

A sleek, responsive calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**—developed as the **final project** for my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) course.

This project demonstrates a hands-on application of algorithmic thinking through custom evaluation of infix expressions, DOM manipulation, and basic UI design—*entirely without external libraries or frameworks.*

## 🛠 Features

- Arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `×`, `/`, `(`, `)`
- Manual **infix to postfix** conversion and evaluation
- Custom logic instead of relying on `eval()`
- Responsive and visually organized layout
- Clean UX with **clear** and **delete** functions
